# Changes

What changes from one release of mutastic for Rust to the next, written as changes land. The
newest come first.

## Unreleased

### Scoring changes

Expect your score to move, for these reasons, not because your tests changed:

- **`mutastic/unwrap-try` is in the defaults.** `f()?` becomes `f().unwrap()`, so the error `?`
  would hand back panics instead. When no test makes that call fail, the mutant is missed: an error
  path no test runs, which line coverage can't see, since the line runs either way. It was in
  `stronger`; now every run has it unless `--operators` says otherwise. A `?` that passes on only a
  formatter's error (inside a `Display` or `Debug` `fmt`, or on a write to a `Formatter`) is skipped
  as equivalent, since no test can make it fail. Crates that use `?` get more mutants and their
  scores usually fall a little: on five real crates, the defaults score moved by between −1.7 and
  +0.4 points. No mutant's id changes, and `--operators=stronger` and `extended` are unchanged. See
  [Unwrap try](docs/operators/returns.md#unwrap-try).

### Changes

- **A flaky test is left out of the run, not a reason to stop it.** A test that fails before any
  mutant runs again on its own, up to three times, as in the Java edition. One that then passes is
  flaky: the run goes on without it, and says so: `(1 flaky, left out)` on the coverage line,
  `! flaky: … failed, then passed when run again; left out of this run; it reaches RandomState`
  before the summary, a `Flaky` row, a `flaky:` line in the agent text, and `flaky` and
  `flakyEvidence` in the event stream. What it reaches that varies is read from the source: calls
  such as `SystemTime::now` or `rand::thread_rng`, and a `RandomState` field a method reads. Its
  catches don't count, so code only it reaches is not covered. A test that fails every time still
  stops the run, now in the Java edition's words, `the tests fail without any mutant: …; their
  output is in target/mutastic/tests.log`, where it used to say to mark the test `#[ignore]`, which
  agents are told never to do. See [A test is flaky](docs/troubleshooting.md#a-test-is-flaky).
- **A statement that only writes output is skipped as arid,** and counted: `println!`, `eprintln!`,
  `dbg!` and a logger's macros (`log::warn!`, `tracing::info!`). Before, it had no mutant at all, so
  a change that only added a log line ran `0 mutants` and said nothing more; now the summary says
  `1 skipped (1 arid)`, the agent text `(1 more skipped)`, and the event stream has the mutant with
  `skipKind: "arid"`, as the Java edition does. Skipped mutants are out of the score, so no score
  moves, and no existing mutant's id changes. A `mutate:` rule in `mutastic.yaml` takes the skip
  back. See [Remove void call](docs/operators/calls.md#remove-void-call).
